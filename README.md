# tet

A simple text editor for the Terminal.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Keybinds currently are Ctrl-Q to quit, and Ctrl-S to save the file that you are writing to.

## TODO

- Seperate structure of the program, and make the program rely less on editor.rs

- Add Syntax highlighting for the Rust programing language
  
- Impliment a search function
  
- Add a way to save the file to a specific location
  
- Add more keybinds, such as delete a whole line, and delete a word, or multiple words

- (Future) Impliment an LSP server, most likely for the Rust language.

- (Future) Impliment a way to have multiple files open at the same time.
